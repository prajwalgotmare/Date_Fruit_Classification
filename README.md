# Date Fruit Classification

This repository contains code for performing multiclass classification of seven different types of date fruits - Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi, and Sagai. The dataset was obtained via the computer vision system (CVS) and consists of 898 images. Through image processing techniques, a total of 34 features, including morphological features, shape, and color, were extracted from these images.

The aim of this study is to classify the types of date fruit using different machine learning method including logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage
The code for performing multiclass classification using logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and Naive Bayes can be found in the fruit_classification.ipynb notebook.

The SVM model gave the best performance with an accuracy of 93.33%.
